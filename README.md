# 👋 Hi, I'm Harsh Tripathi  

🚀 **Backend Developer | 2+ years of experience | Server-side Specialist**  

I’m a backend engineer with 2.5 + Years of experience who is focused on building scalable, reliable, and event-driven systems end to end—from designing core services to deploying and operating them in production environments.

I have hands-on experience designing backend applications with a strong emphasis on performance, fault tolerance, and clean architecture. My work often involves building event-driven workflows using Kafka, handling high-throughput data pipelines, and designing systems that remain stable and predictable under real-world load.

On the cloud side, I’ve worked extensively with AWS, deploying and managing backend services with scalability, security, and operational efficiency in mind. I’m comfortable taking applications from local development to production-ready cloud deployments, understanding both application behavior and infrastructure concerns.

I also bring solid experience at the data layer, working with PostgreSQL for robust relational data modeling and Redis for low-latency caching and fast data access. I care deeply about choosing the right data stores, optimizing query performance, and maintaining consistency and reliability across services.

What motivates me most is building systems that scale gracefully, stay reliable in failure scenarios, and are easy for teams to evolve over time. I enjoy discussing system design, distributed systems, and cloud-native architectures, and I’m always open to exchanging ideas, collaborating on interesting projects, or exploring ways to build better systems together.
